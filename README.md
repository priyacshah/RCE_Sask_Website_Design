Education includes formal education (such as primary, secondary, and post-secondary education) as well as informal and non-formal education (such as the private media and public education by non-governmental organizations). They promote active environmental stewardship, social justice, and intergenerational equity. And the **primary requirement** is to re-design and re-develope [Project & Profile](https://saskrce.ca/blog/profiles-projects/) page in an innovative way in order to mobilize the knowledge work, i.e. what everyone is doing, what knowledge they are gaining, and how others can collaborate.
